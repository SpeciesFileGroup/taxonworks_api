# Changelog

The intent is to document changes to this *documentation* NOT the underlying code.

All (hopefully) notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
This project <em>does not yet</em> adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as the API is evolving and MINOR patches may be backwards incompatible.
